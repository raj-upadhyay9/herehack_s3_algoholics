## Problem Statement

One tap solution for emergencies = provide application user functionality to access emergency services like getting location of hospital, fire fighters, public security with one Tap.

## Proposed Solution

We propose a one tap solution to all the emergency
needs. For every major kind of emergency that a person may be
in, there will be a solution based on your current-location.

* Get all emergency locations near you.
* Share your live location with your loved ones.
* No Internet? Offline Mode notifies nearby emergency services
* Recieve alerts on wide-spread emergencies and get location of the nearest shelters.
